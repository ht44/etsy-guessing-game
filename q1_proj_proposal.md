For my Q1 project, I will attempt to develop a browser game similar to The Price is Right. Players will take turns guessing at the cost of some item, and whoever ventures the closest guess will be named winner of the round.

Unlike on the TV show, however, my reservoir of merchandise will contain only items handmade and unusual. If all goes to plan, each article will be something that most people would never want, buy, or see the use for.

Therein lies the fun. To win, one must continually put the closest price to things that by all appearances should seem valueless and/or pointless.

At the start of a new game, the application should want to know how many players will be participating and for how many turns.

After that, input is simple: each contestant submits a dollar amount as an educated guess. Output is the name of the victor and an updated scoreboard.

My project will be built around the Etsy API, but if there's an API out there that can help me generate random and unique avatars for everyone I might do that as well.

As far as technologies go, I plan to lean on jQuery for my DOM manipulation and API calls, and I want to bring in Velocity.js to polish the user interface with smooth animation.

At this time, the only additional feature I can think of is an optional play clock.
