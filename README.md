For my Q1 project and my first real application, I developed a browser game similar to The Price is Right. Players take turns guessing at the cost of some item, and whoever ventures the closest guess is named winner of the round.

Unlike on the TV show, however, my catalogue features only items handmade and unusual - things that most people frankly wouldn't want, buy, or see the use for.

Therein lies the fun. To win, one must continually put the closest price to products that by all appearances may seem valueless and/or pointless.

At the start of a new game, you specify how many players will be playing, and for how many turns they will play. Also, you get to enter a keyword that influences what sort of items you'll be guessing at (I made it "handmade" by default; change it up to something a little feistier if you want to make the game more humorous!).

Whoever takes the most rounds takes the game! Have fun!
